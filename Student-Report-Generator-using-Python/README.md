### Project Overview

 Student management system form is created using a simple architecture of python datatypes (like lists,dictionaries,strings)....
This project can be even considered as a reference for similar projects like settingup a biometric survey,calculating average population,attendance calculation,registrations etc...


### Learnings from the project

 I have learnt the deepth of python datatypes and their functionalities.Also gained practical knowledge by taking up real-life problems and solving them and a vast knowledge by hands-om python


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project ,datatypes like list and its methods(i.e append,concatenate,removing),dictionary and its methods(i.e calculating sum,updating,creating,getting values,keys),string and its methods(i.e splitting,upper())


### Challenges faced

 Handling dictionaries are little complicated.we need to gain knowledge on  how to implement it,so I faced trouble with that part and overcome by refering to the points that I have jot down.
